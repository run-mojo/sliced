0.2.2 2018-02-27
	* Fix bug where limiting was calculated incorrectly
	  for rates faster than 1 second (i.e., N operations
	  per second). [#13]
	* Fix bug where the case of a value being expired
	  was not checked in `compare_and_swap_with_ttl`. This
	  problem also manifested for fast rates smaller than 1
	  second. [#14]

0.2.1 2017-05-29
	* Minor build fixes.

0.2.0 2016-11-08
	* The project has been renamed from "redis-throttle" to
	  "redis-cell" to avoid naming contention with the
	  multitude of projects that are already named for the
	  former.

0.1.0 2016-11-06
	* Initial release.
